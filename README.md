# 🌟 My 4-Month ML Job Ready Challenge

Hi there! 👋 This is my personal **4-Month ML Job Ready Challenge**. I’ve started this challenge to learn Machine Learning step by step and get ready for a job in the field. Over the next few months, I’ll be focusing on building my skills, doing hands-on projects, and creating something I can be proud of.

## Why Am I Doing This?

I’m really excited about Machine Learning, but I know it can feel overwhelming. There’s so much to learn! So, I’ve decided to create a plan for myself to stay focused and organized. My goal is to:
- Learn the basics of ML and how it works.
- Practice solving real problems with real projects.
- Build a portfolio of my work to show what I’ve learned.

This is my way of making sure I stick to my goal and keep learning every day.

## What’s in This Repo?

This repo is my learning space. Here’s what you’ll find:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: These will have all my notes, code, and examples as I learn new concepts.
- **Projects**: I’ll add small and big projects here to practice what I’ve learned.
- **Progress**: As I finish each part of the challenge, I’ll update this repo to track my progress.

## What’s Next?

At the end of the 4 months, I hope to look back and see how much I’ve grown. I'll share my projects and thoughts about the journey. This is just the start, and I’m excited to see where it takes me!

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out the repo or say hi if you have questions or tips. 😊
